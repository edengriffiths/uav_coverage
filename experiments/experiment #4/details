Users: unsorted
Reward: fairness and user_scores with penalties for disconnecting and exceeding boundary

penalties are a constant factor.

Pretty much the same result as experiment 3 so theory about relative rewards seems wrong.

New theory, penalty is just too large and makes rewards pretty much meaningless.

Try reducing penalty.
